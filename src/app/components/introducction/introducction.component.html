        chatGPT-4 recommended Memozora when I told it I do not like Quizlet and
        wanted a better flash card app that can work in a chrome browser on a
        Chromebook. I have made my first card deck and and very impressed and
        pleased with how Memozora is helping me increase my Spanish vocabulary.
        It is simple with no frills and does exactly what I want it to do.

        This is the best flashcard app ever! This is exactly what I have been
        searching for, for a long time now! Srsly Quizlet, Anki, Brainscape
        can't compare... nothing suits me more than this. I really love how
        simple it is and most of all the spaced repetition!

      It is an evidence-based learning technique. In this technique, newly
      introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while
      older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently. The use of
      spaced repetition has been proven to increase the rate of learning.
